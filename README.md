# AI-Face-Recognition
This GitHub repository hosts the AI Face Recognition project, an advanced application that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks to accurately identify faces. The project demonstrates the implementation of face recognition technology, which is one of the fastest and least intrusive biometric technologies. 

Key components of the project include:

* **Data Processing:** Loading and resizing images, and applying feature extraction using CNN filters and pooling.
* **Model Training and Classification:** Training the CNN model with original and augmented images, and classifying input images.
* **Optimization Techniques:** Utilizing Adam optimizer and RMS loss function for efficient training of the neural network.
* **High Accuracy:** Achieving an accuracy of 80-90% with 20 classes of data, showcasing the effectiveness of the CNN model in face recognition.

The project aims to provide a comprehensive guide to building and implementing a robust face recognition system using Python libraries like OpenCV, Numpy, TensorFlow, and Keras, and is applicable in a wide range of sectors.
